* **Original:** "Perform a root cause analysis to identify the anomaly."
    * **Simplified:** "Find out why the problem happened."
    * **Why it's better:** "Root cause analysis" and "anomaly" are technical. "Find out why the problem happened" is a common phrase.
* **Original:** "Decompose the complex system into modular components."
    * **Simplified:** "Break the big system into smaller parts."
    * **Why it's better:** "Decompose," "modular," and "components" are more complex than "break," "smaller," and "parts."

3. Using Active Voice:

* **Original:** "The report was generated by the system."
    * **Simplified:** "The system generated the report."
    * **Why it's better:** Active voice is generally clearer and more direct than passive voice.

4. Avoiding Acronyms and Abbreviations (or Explaining Them):

* **Original:** "The API returned a 404 error."
    * **Simplified:** "The Application Programming Interface said the page wasn't found."
    * **Why it's better:** Many people may not know what "API" or "404" means. Explaining them makes it accessible to a wider audience.

**Benefits of Simplification:**
